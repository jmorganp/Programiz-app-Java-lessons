// In Java, we can create an array of arrays.
// These arrays are known as two-dimensional arrays.

// An array can also be of more than two dimensions.

// e.g. two-dimensional array declaration
// int[][] data = new int[3][4]

// two-dimensional array initialization
/*

int[][] data = {
    {2, 3, 5},
    {7, 14, 21, 28},
    {1, 3, 5, 7, 9},
}
